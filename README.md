# 🧠 Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict employee salaries based on features like experience, education, job role, and location using machine learning models.

## 📂 Dataset

We used the **Adult Census Income dataset**, a widely used dataset for salary prediction. It includes:
- Age
- Education Level
- Workclass
- Occupation
- Capital Gain/Loss
- Hours per Week
- Income Category (`<=50K` or `>50K`)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**


## 🚀 Model Workflow

1. **Data Loading** – Imported data using pandas
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values, encoded categoricals
3. **Feature Engineering** – Selected important features
4. **Model Training** – Trained Linear Regression and Random Forest
5. **Model Evaluation** – Evaluated using R² Score and RMSE

## 🔍 Results

- Achieved an **R² score above 0.85**
- **Random Forest Regressor** performed best
- Predictions closely matched actual salary categories

## 🧠 Future Scope

- Add real-time job market data
- Use NLP on job descriptions
- Deploy model using Flask or Streamlit
